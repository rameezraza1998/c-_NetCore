Got it 👍 since you **haven’t done file I/O yet** (that’s in Week 4), let’s keep your project **in-memory only** — no saving/loading from files for now.

That’s totally fine: you can build the logic using **classes, collections, LINQ, and events**, and later (after Week 4) you can extend it with file persistence.

Here are **adjusted project ideas** that fit your current level (till Week 3):

---

### 🔹 1. Student Management System (In-Memory)

* **Classes**: `Student`, `Course`, `Grade`
* **Features**:

  * Add/update/remove students
  * Enroll students in courses
  * Use LINQ to:

    * Get students with average grade > 80
    * Find students enrolled in a specific course
    * Group students by course

---

### 🔹 2. Library Catalog (In-Memory)

* **Classes**: `Book`, `Author`, `Borrower`
* **Features**:

  * Add new books
  * Search by title/author using LINQ
  * Sort books by year or title
  * Group by author/genre

---

### 🔹 3. Inventory Tracker (In-Memory)

* **Classes**: `Product`, `Category`
* **Features**:

  * Add/update/remove products
  * Filter products with LINQ (price < 100, category == "Electronics")
  * Group products by category
  * Event: Raise “LowStockAlert” when stock < 5

---

### 🔹 4. To-Do List Manager (In-Memory)

* **Classes**: `TaskItem` (title, due date, status)
* **Features**:

  * Add/update/remove tasks
  * LINQ queries:

    * Get overdue tasks
    * Get tasks due today
    * Group by status (Pending, Completed)

---

👉 Since you just finished **Week 3 (LINQ, events, delegates, OOP)**, I recommend starting with **Inventory Tracker** or **Student Management System** — both give you a chance to use:

* **OOP** (classes, inheritance if needed)
* **LINQ queries** (filtering, grouping, sorting)
* **Events** (e.g., low stock, student added)

Would you like me to **design a class diagram + step-by-step plan** for one of these projects so you can start coding it directly?
